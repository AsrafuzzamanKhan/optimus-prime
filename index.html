                <p>Optimus Prime (formerly known as Orion Pax) is constantly, if not always, depicted as having strong
                    moral
                    character, excellent leadership, and sound decision-making skills, and possesses brilliant military
                    tactics, powerful martial arts, and advanced extraterrestrial weaponry. Optimus Prime has a strong
                    sense
                    of honor and justice, being dedicated to building peaceful and mutually beneficial co-existence with
                    humans, the protection of life and liberty of all sentient species.[3] As the current Matrix of
                    Leadership bearer, Optimus Prime is the de facto leader of the Autobots, a faction of a transforming
                    species of synthetic intelligence from the planet Cybertron. The Autobots are constantly waging
                    civil
                    war against a rival faction of transforming robots called Decepticons. According to Bob Budiansky,
                    co-writer of the Transformers series, Dennis O'Neil was responsible for his name.
